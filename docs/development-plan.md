## Resource Allocation

### Engineering Resources

- **Frontend Engineer**: Focus on UI/UX improvements and component development
- **Backend Engineer**: Focus on Convex functions, authentication, and API integrations
- **Full-stack Engineer**: Connect components and implement cross-cutting features
- **DevOps**: Setup CI/CD pipeline and deployment automation

### External Dependencies

- **Clerk**: Authentication service updates and integration
- **Convex**: Backend service capabilities and limitations
- **Together.ai**: LLM model availability and pricing
- **Replicate**: Whisper model availability and pricing

## Success Metrics

### Reliability Metrics

- Reduce error rate in audio processing pipeline by 95%
- Achieve 99.9% successful note creation rate
- Reduce authentication failures to less than 0.1%

### Performance Metrics

- Average note processing time under 10 seconds
- Frontend load time under 2 seconds
- Search response time under 500ms

### User Experience Metrics

- User satisfaction score above 4.5/5
- Feature usage increase by 30%
- Session duration increase by 25%
- User retention increase by 20%

## Risk Assessment

### Identified Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| API service outages | High | Medium | Implement fallback mechanisms, caching |
| Authentication failures | High | Low | Robust error handling, token refresh |
| Cost increases from AI providers | Medium | High | Implement usage limits, cost monitoring |
| Browser compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | Cross-browser testing, progressive enhancement |
| Data loss | High | Low | Regular backups, data validation |

### Contingency Plans

1. **For API outages**: Implement offline mode with sync when service returns
2. **For auth failures**: Provide clear user guidance and automatic retry
3. **For cost increases**: Implement tiered usage plans and alternative providers
4. **For browser issues**: Maintain browser support documentation and fallbacks
5. **For data concerns**: Create data recovery tools and export functionality
