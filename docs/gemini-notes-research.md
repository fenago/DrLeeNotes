2. **Multimodal Processing**: Ability to work with text, images, and potentially audio inputs
3. **Text Generation**: High-quality summaries, bullet points, and explanations
4. **Structured Output**: Can generate specifically formatted responses (JSON, markdown, etc.)
5. **Context Retention**: Can maintain understanding across multiple related prompts
6. **Few-shot Learning**: Can quickly adapt to specific note-taking styles with examples

### Unique Advantages

1. **Knowledge Integration**: Deep integration with Google's knowledge graph
2. **Multilingual Support**: Strong performance across multiple languages
3. **Real-time Processing**: Fast response times for interactive experiences
4. **Safety Measures**: Built-in content filtering and moderation

## Agentic Workflows in Note-Taking

### What Makes a Workflow "Agentic"?

An agentic workflow empowers AI to act as a proactive assistant rather than a passive tool. Key characteristics include:

1. **Autonomy**: The system can perform tasks with minimal user guidance
2. **Proactivity**: The system anticipates user needs and suggests actions
3. **Context Awareness**: The system understands the broader context of the user's work
4. **Adaptivity**: The system learns from user interactions and improves over time
5. **Multi-step Processing**: The system can handle complex, multi-stage workflows

### Applied to Note-Taking

An agentic note-taking experience might include:

1. **Proactive Organization**: Automatically suggesting categories and tags for notes
2. **Smart Linking**: Identifying connections to previous notes or external information
3. **Question Anticipation**: Generating potential questions that might appear on exams
4. **Study Material Generation**: Creating flashcards, practice questions, and summaries
5. **Follow-up Prompting**: Suggesting areas to research further or clarification needed
6. **Contextual References**: Adding relevant sources, definitions, or examples

## Integration with Existing AgenticNotes Application

The current AgenticNotes application has a solid foundation with:

- Voice note recording capability
- Transcription using Whisper API
- LLM processing via Together.ai
- Action item extraction
- Vector search functionality

These features can be enhanced and expanded by integrating Gemini API:

1. **Replace Together.ai with Gemini**: Utilize Gemini's stronger contextual understanding
2. **Expand Multimodal Capabilities**: Process images alongside voice and text
3. **Enhance Search with Knowledge Graph**: Incorporate Google's knowledge for better search
4. **Implement Agentic Elements**: Add proactive assistance and context management
5. **Unified Format Handling**: Support multiple note formats (text, voice, images, diagrams)

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Considerations

1. **API Integration**: Direct integration with Gemini API, possibly using the official SDK
2. **Stateful Conversations**: Maintaining context across user sessions
3. **Backend Processing**: Offloading heavy processing to server-side functions
4. **Real-time Updates**: Ensuring changes propagate immediately to the user interface
5. **Caching Strategy**: Implementing efficient caching for API responses
6. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Handling API unavailability or rate limiting
